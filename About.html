<p>In general, there is a wide range of approaches employed for identifying stressors causing aquatic life impairments. Most states use assessments methodologies which are iterative, data‐driven, weight‐of evidence approaches that generally follow the EPA 2000 stressor identification guidance document, meaning the SI process is repeated and analyses are performed for each impaired waterbody with a biological impairment to identify candidate stressors. Those states that have developed candidate stressor thresholds have a valuable screening tool that allows for faster implementation of the SI process. Thresholds, when developed appropriately, should allow a state agency to quickly eliminate and identify candidate stressors. Most helpful are those thresholds that include “elimination,” “possible stressor,” and “likely stressor” thresholds. It should be of note that among the states that have developed these stressor thresholds, the methods of development have varied greatly, and in‐turn, the thresholds for determining stress or non‐stress vary.</p>
